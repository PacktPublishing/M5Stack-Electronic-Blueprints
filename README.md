This is the code repository for [M5Stack Electronic Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/product/m5stack-electronic-blueprints/9781803230306), published by Packt.

**A practical approach for building interactive electronic controllers and IoT devices**

## What is this book about?
As an embedded systems developer or an IoT developer, you can often face challenges in maintaining focus on prototyping a product concept while using a specific high-level programming language for implementation. To overcome these challenges, the M5Stack Core platform uses an ESP32 microcontroller and block code that allows you to focus on product creation and application instead of the high-level programming language. M5Stack Electronics Blueprints presents various design and prototyping approaches as well as UI layout and electronics interfacing techniques that will help you to become skilled in developing useful products effectively.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Design user interfaces using no-code/low code programming languages
* Prototype electronic controllers for audio alarms swiftly
* Wire an M5Stack Core 2 to an Arduino Uno or equivalent to build a touch control relay controller
* Prototype Bluetooth IoT controllers efficiently
* Build and code Wi-Fi sniffers and scanner gadgets
* Prototype wearable devices with ease
* Create ESP32 applications using system block diagram design
* Build a DC motor controller operated by a M5Stack Core unit
